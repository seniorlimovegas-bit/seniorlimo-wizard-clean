# SeniorLimo Wizard – Project Log

## Repository: seniorlimo-wizard-clean
Date Started: December 17, 2025

## Current Status
- Created a clean GitHub repository named `seniorlimo-wizard-clean`.
- Set up basic Next.js file structure:
  - pages/_app.js
  - pages/index.js
  - pages/api/chat.js
  - README.md
- Populated these files with clean placeholder code to replace corrupted/combined versions from the previous repo.

## Purpose of Clean Repo
- Avoid confusion caused by mixed or outdated files.
- Establish a solid and minimal working foundation to build on.
- Make debugging and development easier going forward.

## Next Planned Tasks
1. Test whether the current placeholder project runs locally once cloned.
2. Connect the `/api/chat` endpoint to a real AI endpoint instead of a static reply.
3. Build out the UI styling and improve chat functionality.
4. Add environment variable handling for API keys.
5. Prepare the project for deployment (Netlify or Vercel).
6. Begin documenting features and architecture as we develop.

## How to Use This Log
- Each future change should be added here with a short date and summary.
- Acts as a reference so we always know what was done and why.
- Prevents losing context if repos or files change again.
