# Project Log – SeniorLimo Wizard (Clean Repo)

## December 2025

### 12/18/2025 — Repository Initialization
- Created new clean repository: `seniorlimo-wizard-clean`
- Established basic Next.js directory structure:
  - `/pages/_app.js`
  - `/pages/index.js`
  - `/pages/api/chat.js`
  - `/README.md`
- Added baseline code to:
  - `_app.js` — wraps pages & defines global layout behavior
  - `index.js` — basic UI chat page (user input + chat box)
  - `chat.js` — API route returning placeholder reply
- Verified that repo structure is consistent and uncorrupted
- Ready for initial testing & building iterative functionality

### Current Status
- Project boots with a minimal interface and functional chat API stub
- No AI integration yet — API returns static text
- Environment is now clean and version-controlled for incremental development

### Next Planned Steps
- Confirm deployment environment or local dev
- Add actual AI response handling to `/api/chat`
- Begin UI iteration once response pipeline is working
